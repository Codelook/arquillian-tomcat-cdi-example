Skeleton project to setup arquillian on tomcat 7 with cdi injection enabled

Integrating all components and configurations is not quite easy, so i created this project
to act as reference for me but i hope it can help others developers too.

if something is wrong or just not comprehensible do not hesitate to open some issues :)
